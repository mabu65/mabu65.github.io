Glutamate triggers long-distance, calcium-based plant defense signaling

Plants sense local signals.
Glutamate is a wound signal in plants.
Ion channels of the glutamate receptor-like convert the signal into an increase in intracellular calcium ion concentration that propagates to distant organs.

## Intro: Signal networks
- reactive oxygen species
- electrical signals
	Depend on glutamate receptor-like (GLR) proteins -- from pathogen defense to root growth
	How GLRs are triggered by wounding
- changes in cytosolic $Ca^2+$ concentration
	How subsequent $Ca^2+$ related signaling event operate to mediate systemic defense

## Methods
caterpillar (毛虫) on an Arabidopsis plant(拟南芥) expressing the GCaMP3 fluorescent protein-based $Ca^2+$ sensor revealed **an increase in $Ca^2+$ at the herbivory site within 2 s that was transmitted over 1 to 2 min to distal leaves.**
Using scissors also caused a same changing -- herbivore chemical signals are not required.

## Comparison experiments
Wounded leaf 1 and monitored systemic responses in target leaf 6 and non target leaf 5.
