#### I. Environment setup

The whole project runs on the public server in our lab, the virtual environment is necessary. 

```python
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv youknowwho # Create a new python environment

source youknowwho/bin/activate # Set your own file to instead of 'youknowwho'
...
deactivate
```

GRU is a kind of recurrent neural networks, which can extract the features from the time series. GRU removes an output gate compared with long-short-term memory (LSTM). The structure of GRU will be not discussed in this article. 

Why the bidirectional network was applied in this project?

In the major purpose, PAT sequences from past periods can predict or estimate the current BP values (systolic BP and diastolic BP)
