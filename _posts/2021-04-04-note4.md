Project Name: Multi-datasets for Blood Pressure Estimation Based on Deep Learning Networks

#### I. Environment setup

The whole project runs on the public server in our lab, the virtual environment is necessary. 

```python
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv youknowwho # Create a new python environment under your account

source youknowwho/bin/activate # Set your own file instead of 'youknowwho'
...
deactivate
```

GRU is a kind of recurrent neural networks, which can extract the features from the time series. GRU removes an output gate compared with long-short-term memory (LSTM). The structure of GRU will be not discussed in this article. 

In the major purpose, the past PAT sequence can predict or estimate the current BP values (systolic BP and diastolic BP), which might contain the BP-related information. Therefore, the LSTM layer provides a strong ability to extracted time-sequence features from the input PAT. Bi
